GPy

Can mix (+ x) kernels, has many implemented

Is stable, but not developing as fast anymore (not yet stopped dev though)

Can do sparse GPs, can use dimensionality reduced GPs, using PCA results or manually given

Multi-dim output
Non-gaussian likelihoods (as well)
Approximations for large data sets


BoTorch / AX:
Ax: high level black-box BO library
BoTorch: for researchers

BoTorch:
- not only for GPs (should be able to switch)
- PyTorch-like API
Can calculate expectations using MC-sampling, making it tractable to take expectations

Ax:
- Easy to start, less straightforward to configure
- Can use custom models from BoTorch in Ax: ..tutorials/modular_botax.html
- Has a scheduler that takes care of when and where to run experiments
