  <h1 align="left">Bayesian Optimization in Python</h1>

</p>

A repo to show, keep and tinker with Bayesian optimization in python.
This repo is not to be used as something to build upon, but rather a folder of code snippets and resources, e.g. links, articles, videos etc. to show how to use concept, and easily snag for other projects.

* Using Ax (https://ax.dev/), the high level no-frills (no configuration) system
* .. (to come?)

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is not a standalone code, but just a bag of code snippets and other artifacts helping anyone to get started with Bayesian Optimization in python. Feel free to contribute with a pull request!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

It is reccomendet to use conda. , and read this:
For Ax, read this:
For BoTorch, read this: https://github.com/pytorch/botorch/blob/main/README.md
For PyTorch, read this: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

For conda environment: Use conda environment file, and then install BoTorch using conda (conda install botorch -c pytorch -c gpytorch), and subsequently ax using pip (pip3 install ax-platform)

<!-- RESOURCES -->
## Resources:
Ax:
 - Reading: https://ax.dev/docs/api.html, https://ax.dev/tutorials/gpei_hartmann_loop.html

<!-- EXAMPLES -->
## Examples

 - To use just run any python file as a script, it should work. Let me know if it does not


<!-- TESTS -->
## Tests

No test have been set up for the examples.
